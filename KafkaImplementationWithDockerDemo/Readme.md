# Kafka Producer Consumer demo with Docker Setup

### Installed docker package from

[github - cp-all-in-one/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-all-in-one/blob/7.5.0-post/cp-all-in-one/docker-compose.yml)

````console
curl --silent --output docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/confluentinc/cp-all-in-one/7.5.0-post/cp-all-in-one/docker-compose.yml```
````

### Run the command

`docker-compose up -d`

## **_Kafka_**

1. Producer Sending Data to Kafka Cluster
   Producer: The factory creating products (data).
   Data: The products made by the factory.
   Kafka Broker Cluster: The warehouse where products are sent for storage.
   Explanation:
   The factory (Producer) sends products (Data) to a warehouse (Kafka Cluster) where they are stored and managed.

2. Kafka Cluster with Topics and Partitions
   Topics: Sections in the warehouse for different types of products (data categories).
   Partitions: Shelves within each section to organize the products (data).
   Records: Individual products on the shelves, representing specific pieces of data.
   Explanation:
   The warehouse (Kafka Cluster) organizes products into different sections (Topics). Within each section, shelves (Partitions) hold the individual products (Records), ensuring everything is well-organized for easy access.

3. Consumer Retrieving Data
   Consumer: A store picking up products from the warehouse to sell.
   Data Retrieval: The store selects products from specific shelves in the relevant sections.
   Explanation:
   The store (Consumer) visits the warehouse, retrieves the needed products (Data) from the appropriate shelves (Partitions) in the relevant sections (Topics). This shows how Kafka consumers access and use data stored in Kafka.

**Summary**

- Producer (Factory): Creates and sends data.
- Kafka Broker Cluster (Warehouse): Stores and organizes the data.
- Topics (Sections): Categories for organizing data.
- Partitions (Shelves): Subdivisions within topics to manage records.
- Records (Products): The actual data stored.
- Consumer (Store): Retrieves and processes the data.

This analogy simplifies Kafka's architecture, making it easier to visualize how the system works together to manage and process large amounts of data efficiently.
